      "Exotic robusta variety with a unique flavor profile — bold, earthy, and full-bodied.",
    fullDescription: `
      Coffee Canephora, widely known as Robusta, stands out for its powerful, intense character.
      Unlike milder Arabica beans, Canephora offers a strong, almost woody taste with a lingering bitterness.
      It’s rich in caffeine, making it the go-to option for those who crave energy and intensity in a cup.
      Carefully sourced from high-altitude farms, the beans undergo a slow-roasting process to preserve natural oils.
      The result is a brew that’s full-bodied, smooth, and deeply aromatic — a coffee that commands attention.
